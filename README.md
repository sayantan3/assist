Java script project implementing ai chat assistant.
This chat room has data-base and over time it learns and become a good companion.

TODO (these are broader/there are sub goals too):
1. Making front-end and back-end using basic html and js
2. Using a database intially locally host 
3. Using an efficent and simple machine learning algorithm - what can learn over time

future-scope:

how to make it more private/anonimizing user and their request
adding an api for people want to use 


System-design ::

send-message(human) -> receivied-message(ai) -> ml -> reply(human)

single sessions design 

TCP -> websocket (WSS) - great for chat application
